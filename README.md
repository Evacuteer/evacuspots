#evacuspots

[Evacuspots](http://www.evacuteer.org/evacuspots/) are pick-up locations for
the New Orleans City Assisted Evacuation. Most of these spots are marked by a
distintive statue. This project contains data about the evacuspots.

Evacuspots are cool.
a counter tool that allows for the evacuteers to keep better track of the amount of people that need help.
